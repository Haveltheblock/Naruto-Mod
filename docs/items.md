Items in the mod: Paper Bombs
description: The paper bomb is a ninja tool that works like a landmine. It can be placed down on almost any type of surface, but can be broken by flowing water. Upon placing it down, it will start to blend in with the surface of the block it is placed on after a few seconds, making it easy for unsuspecting mobs and players to accidently walk on top of it, causing it to explode. Paper bombs can also manually be set off by right clicking them, causing them to light up with some fire sprites, and explode after a few seconds.
